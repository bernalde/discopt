"""#1612: HiGHS kOptimal downgraded to ``feasible`` by the #1410 root-dual check.

The #1410 guard measures each reduced cost's violation relative to its own scale
``|c_j| + (|A|ᵀ|y|)_j``. On a slack column (``c_j = 0``) whose row dual is round-off zero
that scale IS round-off, so a ``1e-14`` wrong-signed dual reads as a relative violation of
``1.0`` and a perfectly solved set-cover LP voids the MILP certificate. A knapsack's
``6.8e-14`` violation tripped the same check against a ``4.3e-14`` round-off bound.

The fix keeps the per-column test as a sufficient condition and, when it fails, asks the
rigorous question instead: does HiGHS's own root pair certify the root LP? The
Neumaier--Shcherbina bound from HiGHS's duals over the declared box (after zeroing a
wrong-signed reduced cost on an open singleton column, which NS cannot charge) must meet
HiGHS's primal objective within the route's LP certificate yardstick. NS is a valid
bound for any dual, so the check cannot be fooled by the repair; on the #1410 matrix,
which HiGHS mis-solves, the gap is ``0.022`` and the certificate is still refused.
