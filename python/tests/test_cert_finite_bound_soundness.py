"""Soundness: ``gap_certified=True`` requires a finite dual bound.

A *certified* optimality gap is a claim that the reported dual (lower) bound is
a rigorous certificate. A non-finite bound (``±inf``) or an absent bound
(``None``) certifies nothing — e.g. a ``time_limit`` termination where no node
ever produced a finite relaxation bound leaves the global lower bound at
``-inf``. Reporting ``gap_certified=True`` there is a *false certification*: a
benchmark/phase gate that counts ``gap_certified`` as "solved" would miscount
the instance.

This surfaced while triaging issue #139 (bucket 2, products with a nonlinear
factor): instances ``nvs20`` and ``st_e36`` drop their objective term from the
MILP relaxation (no valid bound), then on ``time_limit`` reported
``status=time_limit obj=None bound=-inf gap=inf gap_certified=True``.

The guard lives in ``SolveResult.__post_init__`` so every construction path is
covered. Infeasibility certificates are exempt: ``status="infeasible"`` with
``gap_certified=True`` certifies infeasibility, not a gap, and legitimately
carries ``bound=None``.
