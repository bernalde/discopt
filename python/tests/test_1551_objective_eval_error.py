"""#1551: no certificate finer than the objective's own float resolution.

``min 6y^2 + By + C`` with ``y`` integer in ``[c, c+3]``, ``B = -(12c+12)`` and
``C = 6c^2+12c`` is the shifted quadratic of #1543 written out in expanded form.
At ``c = 2345678.9`` each term is ~3.3e13 (ulp ~4e-3), so float64 cannot
evaluate the objective to better than ~1e-2 anywhere in the box. The OA
auto-route returned ``objective = bound = -5.9375`` as ``gap_certified=True``
while the exact optimum of the function as written is ``-5.93832`` -- a lower
bound 8.2e-4 above the optimum, past the 5.9e-4 tolerance it was certified at.

The guard measures the objective's evaluation error at the incumbent as the width
of an outward-rounded interval enclosure, and withdraws a certificate (and its
bound) whose pair no longer closes the requested gap once widened by that error.
