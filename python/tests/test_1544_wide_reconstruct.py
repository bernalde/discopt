"""Issue #1544: a wide canonical sum/product must not reconstruct to a deep tree.

A canonical ``sum``/``prod`` node is n-ary; ``reconstruct`` used to left-fold it into
an ``n``-deep binary ``Expression``. Every consumer of that tree on the relaxation
path (``evaluate_interval`` in ``uniform_relax._Builder.bounds``, the curvature
classifier, the DAG compiler) recurses per level, so a *shallow* model whose
canonical form has one wide node raised ``RecursionError`` in the relaxation build:

* ``nvs09`` under ``x = y - c``: ``(prod x_i)**0.2`` becomes a product of ten shifted
  binomials, which distributes to a 1024-term sum under the power -- 490 nested
  interval-eval frames from a 24-deep objective;
* the class needs no shift: ``sin(sum(x)/100)`` with 600 ``x`` reached the same crash
  site, cost the solve its relaxation and returned an uncertified ``feasible``.

Wide nodes now fold as a balanced tree. Up to ``_RECONSTRUCT_FOLD_WIDTH`` the legacy
left fold is kept, so every node that already reconstructed is byte-identical.
