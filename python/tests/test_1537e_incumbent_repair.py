"""#1537 workstream E: the published incumbent is repaired to float noise.

``verify_point``'s row allowance ``ABS_TOL * max(1, |rhs|, max_j |J_ij x_j|)`` is
not invariant under a change of variables that leaves the model identical (the
floor ``1`` does not scale with a row; ``|x_j|`` grows with the origin's
distance), so a solver's working-accuracy residual passed it in one set of
coordinates and failed it in the identical model in another -- and the
objective reported at that point was bought with the residual. The corpus
witnesses (all three were strict xfails in ``test_1537_invariance.py``):

* ``ex14_1_9`` with rows x1e-3: certified ``x1 = -9.98e-6`` against a true
  minimum of ~0, on a row residual of 9.98e-9 (9.98e-6 in the original units);
* ``ex1225`` shifted ~1e6: certified 30.9999959 against 31 on an equality
  residual of 2.1e-6 that the shifted row's term scale allowed;
* ``syn05hfsg`` shifted ~1e6: a published incumbent violating row 38 by 6.7e-6.

The repair (``feasibility.repair_point``) is a minimum-norm Newton projection,
itself invariant under both transforms; these tests pin that invariance and the
end-to-end behaviour on the witnesses.
