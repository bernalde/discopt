"""#1612 remainder (X-30d): a HiGHS MILP certificate closed only by HiGHS's feasibility
tolerance is re-solved at a tighter tolerance instead of being withdrawn downstream.

C-06 (set cover) and E-03 (knapsack) are covered by
``test_1612_highs_root_dual_ns_gap.py`` (PR #1636). X-30d is a different mechanism:
HiGHS's incumbent violates a row by its 1e-6 ``mip_feasibility_tolerance``, so its
objective -- and the bound it stops on -- sit 1e-6 beyond the true optimum 41. The
post-solve incumbent repair moves the objective back to 41, the published gap is then
``9.99999997e-7`` against ``abs_gap = 1e-6``, and the #1551 float-resolution guard
(``1.4e-14``) withdrew the certificate and dropped the bound.
