"""#1565: presolve walks over a shared expression DAG must be linear in its size.

A reduced-space NN embedding (OMLT ``ReducedSpaceSmoothNNFormulation``) is one
expression in which every hidden activation is referenced by every unit of the
next layer, so its *tree* is exponentially larger than its *DAG*: a width-20,
depth-3 sigmoid net is 2,889 distinct nodes but 148,206 tree nodes. The
bound/error walks in ``gdp_reformulate`` (reached from factorable denominator
clearing), the clearable-denominator search and the structure-cut recognizer's
SymPy translation all walked it as the tree, which is how ``solve(time_limit=30)``
ran 66 s on a width-25 net and more than 10 minutes on a width-50 one.

These tests pin the walks to the DAG -- by counting calls, not by timing -- and
check the memoised results are exactly those of a walk over the same expression
re-built *without* sharing (which is what the old tree walk computed).
