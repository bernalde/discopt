"""#1640: the #1634 presolve-free cross-solve's bound is a feasibility-tolerance artifact.

On the #1494 piecewise ``log``/max case at a large offset the presolved HiGHS solve
certifies 0 exactly, while the presolve-free cross-solve stops at bound -1.5e-6:
HiGHS's tree bound over node LPs solved to ``mip_feasibility_tolerance = 1e-6``. The
bound scales with that tolerance (-1.5e-8 at 1e-8) and does not move with
``mip_abs_gap = mip_rel_gap = 0``. #1638 published the weaker bound, which reopened the
1e-6 absolute gap and lost the certificate. The fix re-asks the cross-solve at
:data:`CROSS_TIGHT_FEAS_TOL` only when its bound reopened the gap.
