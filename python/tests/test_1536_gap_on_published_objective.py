"""#1536: a certificate is a statement about the PUBLISHED (objective, bound) pair.

The HiGHS MILP route handed HiGHS a constant-free objective (``offset_ = 0``) with
``mip_rel_gap = gap_tolerance``. Under the change of variables ``x = y - 1e6`` the
constant-free part ``c . y`` is ~1e6 at every feasible point, so HiGHS stopped on a
gap of 35.7 / 1e6 and discopt published ``objective=-1, bound=-36.67`` as
``gap_certified=True`` for a model whose optimum is -36.

Two fixes, each tested on its own:

* the route gives HiGHS the objective constant, so its stopping rule measures the
  objective discopt publishes (``test_shifted_milp_*``, ``test_translation_panel``);
* ``solve_model`` refuses to publish a certificate whose own pair fails the
  abs-OR-rel test, whatever the route did (``test_guard_*``), so a route whose
  engine applies its stopping rule to a transformed objective cannot leak one.
