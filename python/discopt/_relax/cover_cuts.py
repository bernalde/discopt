"""Knapsack cover cuts for binary MILP relaxations (roadmap Phase 3).

For a binary-knapsack row ``sum_{j} a_j x_j <= b`` with ``a_j > 0`` and
``x_j in {0,1}``, a *cover* ``C`` is a set with ``sum_{j in C} a_j > b`` — its
items cannot all be chosen, giving the valid cut

    sum_{j in C} x_j <= |C| - 1.

This cut never excludes a feasible 0/1 point (picking every item in a cover
violates the knapsack row), so it is rigorously valid regardless of the LP
point used to find it. Separation looks for a cover that the current LP
solution ``x*`` *violates* (``sum_{j in C} x*_j > |C| - 1``).

Basis-free (no simplex tableau / crossover needed), so it composes with the
interior-point relaxations of the self-hosted B&B.
