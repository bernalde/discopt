"""
McCormick relaxation NLP solver for computing valid lower bounds in B&B.

Builds a convex NLP from McCormick relaxations of the objective and constraints,
then solves it with POUNCE (the pure-Rust Ipopt port). The optimal value of the
convex relaxation is a valid lower bound on the original nonconvex problem over the
node's domain. (The JAX IPM previously used here is retired; the relaxation
*functions* remain JAX-built.)

Mode:
  - **nlp**: Solve a convex NLP minimizing the McCormick underestimator subject
    to McCormick-relaxed constraints. Its optimum is a valid lower bound.

The former **midpoint** mode — evaluate the underestimator at the box midpoint
and return that value — was removed (correctness issue C-18): ``u(midpoint)`` is
not a valid lower bound on ``min_box u`` (e.g. for ``x**2`` on ``[1, 3]`` it
returns 3.0 while the true minimum is 1.0), so it could certify a wrong optimum.
The only sound cheap bound is the minimum of the (convex) underestimator over the
box, which is precisely what the ``nlp`` mode computes.
