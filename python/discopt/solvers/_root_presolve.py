def coef_tighten_enabled() -> bool:
    """Whether ``DISCOPT_COEF_TIGHTEN`` opt-in flag is set (default OFF, #282).

    Bound-changing presolve (CLAUDE.md §5): the strengthened LP relaxation is
    only smaller than the original, never larger, so it is sound.

    **§5 state (#1414, 2026-09-21): KEPT AS A DOCUMENTED OPT-OUT.** The
    graduation panel was run, and the three-outcome rule needs an answer, so here
    it is with the numbers.

    *Why it is not the default.* BAR 1 (cert-clean) passes; BAR 2 (net-positive)
    does not. Measured on the in-repo corpus over the 92-instance population where
    ``tighten_bigm_coefficients`` actually fires (flag ON vs OFF, 60 s/instance):

      * node count — 95.0 % of scored instances neutral (±2 %), pooled ON/OFF
        ratio 1.0542, i.e. very slightly *worse*;
      * answer quality — 0 of 92 status transitions, no ``error`` rows in either
        arm; bound 4 tighter / 5 looser / 7 same, incumbent 3 better / 2 worse /
        2 equal. The bound/incumbent rows are single-rep and time-limited, so
        they measure progress at 60 s rather than relaxation strength; the status
        column is the robust part, and it is flat.

    A cert-clean but neutral flag does not graduate (the ``DISCOPT_CUT_INHERIT``
    lesson: sound is not the same as helpful).

    *Why it is not retired either.* It is the only mechanism in the tree that
    removes the #1380/#1414 big-M weakness at the source rather than coping with
    it: on ``min -x + 3z`` s.t. ``x <= M z``, ``x in [0, 10]``, ``z`` binary, it
    rewrites the row to ``x <= 10 z``, which makes the relaxation exact and leaves
    the search nothing to branch on (0 extra nodes at every ``M``). The default
    path now certifies that class on its own — #1414 fixed the root dive, the
    fathom-and-promote and the pinned-column trust that made it fail — but it
    does so by *branching*, and a user whose model is a wall of big-M indicator
    rows is exactly the case where paying presolve to delete that branching is
    the better trade. The corpus cannot see this because MINLPLib's big-M rows
    arrive already tightened by the modeller.

    *What would change it.* A differential panel on a population of
    **user-authored** big-M models (rows whose indicator coefficient exceeds the
    implied bound), showing the node-count win the repro shows. Wiring exists for
    the run: add an ``ARMS`` entry in ``generality_sweep.GRADUATION_ARMS`` so
    ``graduation_gate.py`` drives it.

    *Scope note (#1610 C-14, 2026-10-04).* The panel above predates two scope
    changes: the pass now reads rows over flat slots (array blocks and
    vector-valued bodies, which it previously declined outright), and it writes
    the discrete bounds its propagation proves (implied fixings) instead of
    discarding them. The in-repo corpus is all scalar ``.nl``, so the first
    change is invisible to it; a re-run of the graduation panel must include
    array-built models.

    Its Stage-2 verdict document (``docs/dev/issue-282-stage2-verdict.md``)
    reports ``syn40m`` +2608 → +1145 % and 52-62 rows tightened on the ``rsyn*``
    family, where the root barely moves. What that document FALSIFIES is
    **Stage 2** (Marchand-Wolsey VUB substitution plus a sustained aggregation
    loop), not Stage 1, which is this flag; do not read its banner as a verdict on
    coefficient tightening.

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Activity-based big-M coefficient tightening (issue #282, Stage 1)
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Standard MIP presolve (Savelsbergh 1994; Achterberg 2007): for a linear
# row ``Σ_{j≠k} a_j x_j + a_k y ⋈ b`` with ``y ∈ {0,1}`` binary and the rest
# of the activity bounded, the coefficient ``a_k`` can be shrunk toward the
# activity slack without removing any *integer-feasible* point, while the LP
# relaxation strictly tightens at fractional ``y``.
#
# Two cases, both derived for a normalised ``≤`` row (``≥`` rows are reflected):
#
#   Umax = max activity of the rest (Σ_{j≠k} a_j x_j) over the current box.
#
#   * ``a_k > 0``  (Savelsbergh):  slack = b − Umax. If ``0 < slack < a_k``,
#     set ``a_k ← a_k − slack`` and ``b ← b − slack``. At y=0 the row becomes
#     ``rest ≤ Umax`` (implied — no point removed); at y=1 it is unchanged.
#   * ``a_k < 0``  (fixed-charge ``flow ≤ M·y`` ⇒ ``flow − M·y ≤ 0``, a_k=−M):
#     set ``a_k ← b − Umax`` and keep ``b``, applied only when this raises
#     ``a_k`` (reduces the big-M) and keeps it negative. At y=0 the row is
#     unchanged; at y=1 both old and new rows are implied by ``rest ≤ Umax``
#     (no point removed); at fractional y the RHS ``b + |a_k|·y`` shrinks.
#
# Feasible-set EQUIVALENCE (both directions — the #772 lesson):
#   * no integer-feasible point removed: at y ∈ {0,1} the new row is implied by
#     (old row + activity bounds), and the activity bounds hold at every point
#     that is feasible in the original problem with integral binaries (FBBT /
#     implied-bounds / probing inferences are valid exactly on that set);
#   * no point admitted: for y ∈ [0, 1] the new row is pointwise at least as
#     tight as the old one (a_k>0 case: the row shifts by ``slack·(1−y) ≥ 0``;
#     a_k<0 case: the y-coefficient only increases), so the rewritten model's
#     feasible set — even its continuous relaxation over the box — is a subset
#     of the original's.
#
# The activity bound ``Umax`` uses FBBT-tightened bounds (valid over the whole
# feasible region), so the strengthened row is globally valid and remains valid
# at every descendant B&B node (child boxes are subsets of the root box). This
# is exactly what SCIP's presolve does; on the #282 convex panel it is the
# load-bearing root-gap lever (syn40m root excess +2608% → +1145%).
#
# ── #772 POST-MORTEM (why the #770 version produced a FALSE PRIMAL) ──────────
# The #770 math above was valid, but the WRITE-BACK broke two model invariants:
#
#   1. ``Constraint.rhs`` is **always 0.0** in normalized form (documented on the
#      dataclass; every comparison operator constructs ``rhs=0.0``). Consumers —
#      ``NLPEvaluator``, the relaxation compilers, ``_infer_constraint_bounds``
#      (which derives cl/cu from the *sense alone*) — therefore compile the body
#      and test it against 0. #770 moved the Savelsbergh slack into ``con.rhs``
#      (0 → −slack), which every consumer silently dropped: the rewritten row was
#      read as ``body' ≤ 0`` instead of ``body' ≤ −slack`` — a RELAXATION by
#      ``slack`` — admitting integer points infeasible in the original problem
#      (rsyn0805m returned obj 1441.99 > opt 1296.12). The fix: fold the entire
#      tightened row into the body (``body' = sgn·(a·x − rhs)``) and keep
#      ``rhs = 0.0``.
#   2. The evaluator cache (``evaluator_fingerprint``) is keyed on constraint
#      *object identity*, so in-place mutation of ``con.body`` leaves previously
#      compiled evaluators serving the un-tightened rows. The fix: REPLACE each
#      rewritten ``Constraint`` with a new object, which invalidates the
#      fingerprint and forces a consistent re-compile. (The #779 final-incumbent
#      guard intentionally keeps its own pre-presolve snapshot reference.)
#
# NOTE ON LOCATION (why Python, not the Rust ``coefficient_strengthening`` pass):
# the in-tree relaxation LP is compiled from the *Python* model DAG plus
# separately-computed FBBT bound arrays. The Rust presolve orchestrator's
# rewritten constraint bodies are never propagated back to that DAG
# (``propagate_bounds_to_model`` copies bounds only), and the existing Rust
# pass additionally (a) reads *declared* bounds — so it bails on the ``[0,∞)``
# flows this family declares — and (b) skips negative (fixed-charge) binary
# coefficients. Rewriting the Python model at the root is the only place the
# tightened coefficients actually reach the relaxation.

    other elements are capped at 40). This is the textbook single-row

    Every derived bound is relaxed outward by ``1e-9·max(1, |v|)`` before it is
    used, and discrete bounds round with ``int_tol`` slack, so floating-point

    """Activity-based big-M coefficient tightening on ``model`` (issue #282).

    Rewrites linear constraint rows that contain a binary variable, shrinking
    the binary's coefficient toward the activity slack of the rest of the row
    (both positive-coefficient Savelsbergh and negative-coefficient fixed-charge
    cases). Iterates with bound tightening to a fixed point: each round's
    tighter coefficients can tighten bounds, which enables further coefficient
    tightening.

    The transformation preserves the integer-feasible set EXACTLY — no feasible
    point removed AND no infeasible point admitted (see the section comment for
    the two-directional argument and the #772 post-mortem) — while the LP
    relaxation only shrinks. Rewritten rows are REPLACED as new ``Constraint``
    objects with the normalized ``rhs = 0.0`` invariant preserved. Returns the
    total number of rows whose coefficients were tightened across all rounds
    (0 when the flag is off or nothing tightens).

    #1610 C-14 widened the scope:

      * **Array blocks.** Rows are read over flat scalar slots, so a model built
        from ``shape=(T,)`` variables is tightened exactly like its scalar twin.
        A scalar row over ``x[t]`` is replaced in place; a vector-valued body
        (``x <= 1000 * y``) is fanned out per element, and each tightened element
        is APPENDED as its own scalar row — the original vector row stays (it is
        implied by the appended one), so no constraint index shifts.
      * **Per-element bounds.** Rust FBBT is block-level, so its bounds are
        intersected with a per-element linear propagation
        (:func:`_propagate_linear_rows`).
      * **Implied fixings.** Discrete bounds the propagation (or root probing)
        proves — e.g. ``y1 = 1`` from ``x1 >= 2`` and ``x1 <= 40·y1`` — are
        written to the variable bounds, so they reach the tree instead of being
        computed and discarded. The write lands on the solve's model, which
        ``_solve_owns_model`` restores on exit (#1610 C2), so the caller's
        declared bounds are untouched.

    Scope (conservative, sound):
      * only linear rows with an inequality sense and ≥1 binary are rewritten,
      * only rows whose worst-case activity is finite under the current bounds
        (unbounded activity ⇒ skipped, not guessed),
      * only discrete bounds are written back; continuous bounds stay internal.
