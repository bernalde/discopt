"""Public convexity verdict: :meth:`discopt.modeling.core.Model.convexity`.

The solver decides whether to take its convex fast path from a classification
that runs *after* two exact rewrites (:func:`discopt.solver._convexity_rewrites`).
The bare classifier in ``discopt._relax.convexity`` sees the model as written, so
it could call a model nonconvex that the solve then treats as convex -- the #1616
A-01 report: ``minimize x*log(x)`` classified ``False`` and solved on the convex
fast path, because the solve rewrites ``x*log(x)`` to ``entropy(x)`` first.

:func:`convexity` runs the same rewrites and the same classifier walk the solver
dispatches on, and reports which parts were proven.

        is_convex: ``True`` when the objective and every constraint were proven
            convex (for ``maximize``, a concave or affine objective). ``False``
            means *not proven*, not *proven nonconvex*: the classifier is sound
            but incomplete. ``None`` when classification ran out of its time
            budget before reaching a verdict.
        objective_convex: The objective's verdict (``None`` on budget exhaustion).
        constraints: ``(name, proven_convex)`` per constraint, in model order.
            Indicator, disjunctive, SOS and logical constraints are never
            reported convex. Empty on budget exhaustion.
        rewrites: The exact rewrites applied before classifying, in order
            (``"entropy"``, ``"objective_epigraph"``). These are what let a model
            be proven convex here that the bare classifier would not prove.

    For a model with integer or binary variables the verdict is about the
    continuous relaxation, i.e. whether the problem is a *convex* MINLP.

    The verdict is the one the solve dispatches on before presolve. The solve
    tightens variable bounds before some later classifications, and tightening
    can only add proofs (a smaller box never makes a curvature certificate
    fail). So ``is_convex=True`` here means the solve also proves the model
    convex; ``False`` here can still become a proof after bound tightening.
