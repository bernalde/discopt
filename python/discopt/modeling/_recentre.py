"""Exact recentring of large-offset variables before a solve (#1537 workstream C).

A variable whose box sits far from the origin -- ``x in [1e6, 1e6 + 3]`` -- is the
same model as ``x = z + 1e6, z in [0, 3]``, but not the same *numerics*: rows with
activities of ~1e6, objectives whose constant-free part is ~1e6 at every feasible
point, and polynomial expansions with ~c^k terms. The invariance harness
(``python/tests/test_1537_invariance.py``) measured the cost: under ``x = y - 1e6``
the corpus lost 23 of 69 certificates and four models came back with FALSE ones
(#1542, #1543), plus two crashes (#1544).

This module rebuilds such a model in recentred coordinates and maps the result
back. It is an exact change of variables -- no bound, row or objective is
approximated -- so the certified answer of the recentred model is the certified
answer of the original.

Two requirements came out of the entry experiment, both binding:

* **Constant folding.** Substituting ``x = z + c`` alone leaves ``(z + c) - c``
  wherever the user wrote ``x - c``. On ``st_e36`` that unfolded form certified
  *infeasible* on a feasible model (#1542). Every scalar affine subtree is
  therefore rebuilt as ``sum_i a_i z_i + k`` with the constants folded, so
  ``(z + c) - c`` becomes exactly ``z``. With folding the same experiment showed
  0 false certificates and 0 crashes (69 models).
* **Selectivity.** Only a variable whose |anchor| is at least ``ratio`` times its
  box width (and at least ``ratio``) is moved: recentring a well-scaled model is
  not free (st_e36: 89 -> 93 nodes, 11 -> 19 s), and a model with nothing to move
  is solved exactly as before.

Gated by ``DISCOPT_RECENTRE`` (default ON, ``=0`` opts out; CLAUDE.md §5); the
threshold by ``DISCOPT_RECENTRE_RATIO`` (default 100).

      (anchor ``lb``); or
    * **one-sided offset** -- a finite ``lb`` with ``|lb| >= ratio`` on a box at

      anchor ``lb``; or an open ``lb`` with ``|ub| >= ratio``: anchor ``ub``.
