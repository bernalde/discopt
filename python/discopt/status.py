"""The terminal-status vocabulary, and what each member is allowed to claim.

A solve's *status* is the first thing every downstream consumer reads — the
release gate, the benchmark harness, a panel script, a caller deciding whether
to trust an objective. Before #1148 the vocabulary had no member meaning
**"local stationary point, no global claim"**, so a continuous local mode had
only two options and both were wrong:

* reuse ``"optimal"`` — and the benchmark harness scores the row as a *proved
  optimum* (``metrics.is_solved`` is ``status == OPTIMAL``, and
  ``proved_optimal_count`` counts ``gap is None and is_solved`` as proved), so
  a local stationary point is read as a certificate. That is CLAUDE.md §1's
  hard gate, with no slack;
* add an optional ``certified=False`` field beside an unchanged ``"optimal"``
  — which fixes nothing, because every consumer that pattern-matches on the
  *status* inherits the bug.

So the distinct status is the mechanism. An unknown status string maps to
``UNKNOWN`` in the harness, ``is_solved`` is False, and both ``incorrect_count``
and ``proved_optimal_count`` skip the row: a consumer that has never heard of
the local mode **fails closed**. ``gap_certified`` stays a refinement of a
status, never the discriminator.

The states this vocabulary keeps apart
--------------------------------------

1. :data:`OPTIMAL` — certified optimal.
2. :data:`FEASIBLE` (with a finite ``bound``) — certified bound + incumbent, gap > 0.
3. :data:`FEASIBLE` (no ``bound``) — feasible, no bound.
4. :data:`LOCAL_OPTIMAL` — local stationary point, **no global claim**.
5. :data:`LOCAL_LIMIT` — the sibling of the previous entry: a *point*, from a
   local search that stopped on a limit without establishing stationarity.
   Separate from ``LOCAL_OPTIMAL`` for the same reason ``LOCAL_INFEASIBLE`` is
   separate from ``INFEASIBLE``: the weaker claim needs its own name, or it is
   made under the stronger one.
6. :data:`INFEASIBLE` vs :data:`LOCAL_INFEASIBLE` — a *certified* infeasibility
   proof versus a local solver that merely failed to find a point. A stalled
   MPEC continuation must never surface as ``"infeasible"``: that is a false
   certificate in the other direction, and it is why the two have separate
   names rather than a shared one plus a flag.

#: verification, and may never become a dual bound.
LOCAL_OPTIMAL = "local_optimal"
#: A local solver produced a point but never established stationarity: it
#: stopped on an iteration or step-size limit at an *iterate*. Strictly weaker
#: than :data:`LOCAL_OPTIMAL`, and kept apart from it because ``local_optimal``
#: is defined above as "a local stationary point" and a consumer is entitled to
#: read it that way. A Scholtes homotopy whose subsolver did zero iterations
#: returned its own starting point under ``local_optimal`` (#1158 review 3,

#: its residuals — but not under a label that claims more than happened.

# incumbent, gap > 0 -- the documented meaning, which existing callers rely on)
# with ``termination="node_limit"``. ``None`` means the route that answered does
# not record a reason (a single local NLP/LP/QP solve, a decomposition loop).
# The pairing below ("gap" -> optimal, "exhausted" -> optimal/infeasible) is the
